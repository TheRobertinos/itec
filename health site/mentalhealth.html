        PSYCHOTIC DISORDER
    </h5>
    <p>Psychotic disorders are severe mental disorders that cause abnormal thinking and perceptions. People with psychoses lose touch with reality. Two of the main symptoms are delusions and hallucinations.</p>
        <p class="sym3">- Hallucinations means seeing, hearing, or feeling things that don’t exist. For instance, <br> someone might see things that aren't there, hear voices, smell odors, have a "funny" taste <br> in their mouth, or feel sensations on their skin even though nothing is touching their body. <br><br>

           - Delusions are false beliefs that don’t go away even after they've been shown to be false. <br> For example, a person who is certain their food is poisoned, even if someone has shown them that the food is fine, has a delusion. <br><br>
